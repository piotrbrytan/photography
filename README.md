# Photography
My photography portfolio from template created by [rampatra](https://github.com/rampatra/photography)

## Run the website locally to test
1. `$ cd photography` - go to the project directory
2. `$ bundle install` - install gems
3. Change the `baseurl` in `_config.yml`
4. `$ bundle exec jekyll serve` - start/run the website

### Build the website
1. `$ cd photography` - go to the project directory
2. `$ npm install` - install all npm dependencies
3. `$ gulp` - minify css, js, resize images, etc.

Note: You only need to build the website if you make changes such as replacing the images, modifying the css styles, etc.

Thanks to [AJ](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) for the website template which I enhanced for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
